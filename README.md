# Grummerly - a spell-checker of all time
A web-app made with Flask and HTML that accepts a block of text as input and detects misspelt words offering corrections. It also detects repetitive words and will offer a list of synonyms. It was the first webapp I (Ryan) had ever made and I created it with my team at DeltaHacks 8 consisting of myself, Andrew Goetz, Marko Buha, and Ayman K. Siddiqui.
